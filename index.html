            each
            of my
            jobs - in trade i reached best seller few times, in installing i been a team leader(in peak i have abot
            20ppl
            in
            team!).

            I donâ€™t know my actual english level, because i never passed tests for that. But the last two years i
            lived
            and worked
            aboard so i have a lot of practice in verbal English. Watching interesting movies and shows in Enlish is
            easy for me. I
            think my level is about B2 at least.
